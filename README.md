# Wifi Scan

Run wifi scan to detect and publish number of active networks in each channel.

## Docker

To build the docker image

```
docker build -t  wifiscan .
```

To start wifiscan container

```
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped --name wifiscan --network host --privileged wifiscan
```

Running with different settings (e.g., change delay time)

```
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped --name wifiscan --network host --privileged -e DELAY=1800 wifiscan
```

## Configuration

Configuration is done with environment variables:

Name | Description | Default
---|---|---
DELAY | Number of seconds between scans | 600 (10 minutes)
WLAN | Interface to use | wlan0
SSID | SSID name | 
MQTT_URL | Mqtt broker IP | 192.168.0.100
MQTT_TOPIC | Mqtt topic | wifi/scan
LEVEL | Threshold dBm level for counting | -999

## Home assistant sensor

The application publish:

  - App version
  - Number of discovered networks in the state field
  - Total number of networks per channel in the channels field.
  - SSID channel with the channel of the specified SSID (0 if not specified).
  - Highest level received per channel (in dBm)

```
{"state":6,"version":"1.0.3","ssid_channel":6,"channels":[0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,0],"levels":[-100,-100,-100,-100,-100,-100,-21,-100,-100,-100,-100,-64,-100]}
```

The following sensor can be used to track the number of networks in wifi channel 7:

```
sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: Wifi channel 7
    icon: mdi:wifi
    state_topic: "wifi/scan"
    value_template: "{{ value_json['channels'][6] }}"
```

Sensor for the SSID channel (if SSID is specified in the configuration):

```
sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: Wifi ssid channel
    state_topic: "wifi/scan"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.ssid_channel }}"
```

And the total number of detected networks:

```
sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: Wifi total networks
    icon: mdi:counter
    state_topic: "wifi/scan"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.state }}"
```

## Lovelace

With [bar-card](https://github.com/custom-cards/bar-card) you can also show a graph of the channels:

## Wifi channels and frequency

Channel | Frequency
---|---
Channel 01 | 2.412 GHz
Channel 02 | 2.417 GHz
Channel 03 | 2.422 GHz
Channel 04 | 2.427 GHz
Channel 05 | 2.432 GHz
Channel 06 | 2.437 GHz
Channel 07 | 2.442 GHz
Channel 08 | 2.447 GHz
Channel 09 | 2.452 GHz
Channel 10 | 2.457 GHz
Channel 11 | 2.462 GHz
Channel 12 | 2.467 GHz
Channel 13 | 2.472 GHz
